text: "This campaign entitled “Dictators don't stop” was published in France in April 2012. 
The new HEC Paris brand campaign displays a vision: “Tomorrow is Our Business”, which focuses on 
business and the future. The economic world has never evolved as quickly and as profoundly as it does
today. Since HEC trains the business leaders of tomorrow, it is best placed to reinvent it and to 
guide this unprecedented transformation.The 45-second film was shot on campus in October 2017 by 
director Bertrand Touchard. It mobilized students during their studies who were willing to take part
in the game of figuration and interpretation, as well as three professional actors. 
It immerses us in the world of the school, deliberately made timeless, to share with us moments 
of the life of students who tomorrow will have a positive impact on their environment.
The campaign, designed and produced by BETC, which has supported HEC Paris on a pro bono basis 
since 2012.To find out more http://tomorrowisourbusiness.com/fr/

It was created for the brand: Urgence Darfour, by the advertising agencies: BEING and TBWA. 
This film campaign is linked to the public interest and NGO industry."
